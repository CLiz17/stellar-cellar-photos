Ok, I think we should make stairwells and railings as our category number nine and make this a 12 picture gallery, with pic 10 commercial doors, pic 11 commercial doors, and gate doors as pic 12.
I figure that anyone looking at the site on a phone or computer monitor can just scroll down to see more pictures.
So, use the nicest picture for pic 9 that will be labelled - “Stairwells, railings, and custom iron works.” Use the other picture as a gallery that you will build a link to.
